Cronjobs can be run on the K8s cluster. 

In this example, we backup mysql db on YOUR-FQDN, host running Bugzilla. 

- package the backup script into Docker image
  (you'll need root's private key) 
- push docker image (bugzilla-stage-bk:demo) into OCIR
- create cronjob yaml file

- to create cronjob object run: 
 $ kubectl create -f cronjob.yml

- other commands:
$ kubectl get cj
$ kubectl describe cj <cj-name>

- When running cronjob, k8s creates a pod and runs job inside it !!

#### Note:
On Nov 1st 2020 there was OCI incident,
affecting network infrastructure (Japan, Germany, US East (Ashburn), US West (Phoenix)). 
Some kubectl commands had output:
"error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)"
