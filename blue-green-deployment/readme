Blue-green deployment is switch at once from one to newer version of an app. 
Here, we switch at once from Nagios4.4.5 to Nagios4.4.6.

Note: this is example using pvc, so have them created first !!!
------------------------------------------------------------

- Create Nagios 445 deployment first, 

 $ kubectl create -f deployment-nagios445-pvc.yml 

- Create service with selector for nagios445 (app: ol7nagios445),
  this selector will be changed later to switch between deployments/nagios

 $ kubectl create -f service-internal-lb.yml

- Create new deployment, nagios446

 $ kubectl create -f deployment-nagios446-pvc.yml 

- At this moment, there are two deployments running in parallel, 
  see them and the service, and review their 'selector'

 $ kubectl get deployment,service -o wide

 Nagios is accessed via http://100.x.x.x/nagios

- Use service selector to switch between deployments at once. 

 $ kubectl set selector service/ol7nagios-service-lb app=ol7nagios446

- If there is any problem with new app (ex. nagios446), undo the change by setting service selector back to previous one.
